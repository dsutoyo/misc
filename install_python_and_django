Installing MySQLdb in Leopard
-----------------------

Step 1:
  Download the latest MySQL for Python adapter from SourceForge.

Step 2:
  Extract your downloaded package by typing

  $ tar xzvf MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz

Step 3:
  Inside the folder, clean the package by typing

  $ sudo python setup.py clean

Step 4:
  In the same folder, edit _mysql.c using your favourite text-editor

  4a. Remove the following lines (37-39):

  #ifndef uint
  #define uint unsigned int
  #endif

  4b. Change the following:

  uint port = MYSQL_PORT;
  uint client_flag = 0;

  to

  unsigned int port = MYSQL_PORT;
  unsigned int client_flag = 0;

Step 5:
  Create a symbolic link under lib to point to a sub-directory called mysql. This is where it looks for during compilation.

  $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql

Step 6:
  Edit the setup_posix.py and change the following

  mysql_config.path = "mysql_config"

  to

  mysql_config.path = "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config"

Step 7:
  In the same directory, rebuild your package (ignore the warnings that comes with it)

  $ sudo python setup.py build

Step 8:
  Install the package and you are done.

  $ sudo python setup.py install

Step 9:
  Test if it's working. It works if you can import MySQLdb.

  $ python
  >>> import MySQLdb
